---

Distributing your app to your users is a critical process in the development of any product. This documentation will cover topics related to app distribution, such as how to:

- [Create native builds](building-standalone-apps/) you can submit to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store
- Add important OS-level resources such as [home screen icon](../guides/app-icons/) and [splash screen](../guides/splash-screens/)
- Manage different [release environments](release-channels/) for your app
